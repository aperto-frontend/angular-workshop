## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding (CLI)

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Switch branches (GIT)

To switch between the exercise branches using the console

`git reset --hard`

`git checkout -b feature/exercise-NUMBER`
